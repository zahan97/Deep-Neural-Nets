# Convolutional Neural Network
Trained on mnist data-set in tensorlfow.. <br /><br />
Accuracy on training set is  0.99 <br />
Accuracy on test set is 0.9892

# Recurrent Neural Network
Trained on all the plays of Shakespeare using tensorlfow..<br />
The RNN has Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) cells.. <br />
The training is done at character level and text is encoded using a 98 element vector..<br />
As the rnn trains, the random output plays become more and more sophisticated and realistic..<br /><br />
The Random plays generated by the network at various stages in training are stored [here](https://github.com/zahan97/Deep-Neural-Nets/blob/master/recurrent%20neural%20network/random_shake_generated.txt)... <br />
